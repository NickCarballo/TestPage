    <h1>About me!</h1>
    <br><br><br><br>
    <div>
        <p> My name is Nicholas Carballo and I am a Senior student studying Information Technology! I currently attend Florida International University but will be graduating December 13, 2019! I have a strong passion for technology and have been taking computers
            apart since I was a kid. My main focus in technology is building a bridge between technology and the user. The idea of a person not being able to enjoy a technology solely due to a poor user interface is a true tragedy. I love technologies
            and want as many people to enjoy them as possible. We went from only scientist using computers to most people having a computer in their pocket. I want to contribute to the usability of existing and upcoming technologies.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <p> Apart from my school's curriculum I have been studying front end development, using coding languages such as html, css and javascript. Other hobbies of mine include BMX, Photography, Videography and photo/video editing. I am familiar with Adobe
            Lightroom and Adobe Photoshop. I am also familiar with several video editing softwares such as Adobe premiere elements, Adobe Premiere Pro, Adobe After Effects and Sony Vegas Pro.
